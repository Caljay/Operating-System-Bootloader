This was my first attempt at making a bootloader/operating system on the x86 architecture
It went decently well, but for some reason the GDT did not seem to work, and the bootloader would
not enter 32 bit protected mode. 

Followed "Writing A Simple Operating System from Scratch" by Nick Blundell
it appears to have not been completed at all and contains lot of missing information
